Experience of my last day of b.tech life at MVSR
The Last working day of clg life at MVSR was so good
Actually i had an Sem exam on that day 
And all were busy in preparations
At the end of the day all the members of our batch have written the day very well
After the exam we have met at the cse block
And taken a good pic
We have also taken a individual photos with the faculties
And planned to box cricket with my friends
Finally i have spent a wonderful day
It was an emotional day filled with memories
